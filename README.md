Code that we use for chess robot:  Master, Slave and Stockfish Final.


Master:  
  Used for monitoring sensors

Slave:  
  Used for communication between Stockfish(Python) and arduino. The Slave is also used to communicate with stepper motors.

Stockfish Final:  
    This code is used to communicate with a stockfish Engine. This Engine must be downloaded from stockfishchess.org.  
  
While playing between presentations we decided to increase the speed and acceleration. Without any problem we increased the speed and acceleration 300%  
Maxspeed can be set too 3000 and acceleration to 1500. Increasing the speed and acceleration led to a smoother experience overall. Main code is not altered to this speed :)
